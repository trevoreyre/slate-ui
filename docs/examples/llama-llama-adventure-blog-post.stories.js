      <h1>RV Office</h1>
      <p>
        Figuring out a good office setup in the RV took some doing. Like, a LOT
        of doing. But in the end, I'm very happy with the results. I actually
        have a couple different work setups - the main "office" in the hallway
        of our RV, and an outdoor setup I use in our tent when the weather
        allows. I also have a more mobile setup I can use anywhere, for when the
        internet at the campground calls it quits and says, "Not today, buddy!
        Not today." Flexibility is the name of the game in full time RV life.
      </p>

        The hallway is my "office" in the RV. We have a 36 foot fifth wheel with
        a mid bunk. The bedroom in the middle of the RV would probably be the
        most natural choice for an office space, if it didn't belong to our
        daughter, Lennon. I might hold that against her if she wasn't literally
        the cutest human in the entire universe.

        So the hallway it is. My hallway setup involves a

        >
          floor to ceiling autopole
        </a>
        that I mount my monitor on. I had no idea what an autopole was before I
        started this venture. It's something you'd find in a photography or
        video studio, which they use to mount lights, backdrops, and that kind
        of stuff. The pole is pressure fit, which means we didn't have to drill
        any holes to mount it. I bought a

          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          monitor arm
        </a>
        that's made to mount to the pole, and it's held up my 34" ultra-wide
        monitor for a couple years now without skipping a beat.
      </p>
      <p>
        My "standing desk" is actually a
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3mWHz0T" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          percussion table
        </a>
        . Like the kind a drummer would use to hold a laptop next to them while
        they're drumming. I ordered a custom mouse pad to fit the exact
        dimensions of the percussion table, and secured it with washers and
        bolts in the four corners.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also use an
        <a href="https://amzn.to/2YrUbUf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          anti-fatigue standing mat
        </a>
        so my feet don't get too tired from standing the whole day. If I do get
        tired, I have a very slim, foldable,
        <a href="https://amzn.to/2Yrte30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          height-adjustable chair
        </a>
        I can whip out and set up in the hallway. It's not the most comfortable
        chair in the world, but it folds completely flat, and stows away nicely.
        And it does the job to give my feet a break when they need one. I've
        gotten more and more used to standing while working, so I rarely use the
        chair any more. But it definitely comes in handy.

      <h2>The tent office</h2>
      <p>
        The tent office is a more recent addition. We purchased a
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3mX7wNN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          Clam Quick-Set tent
        </a>
        , and we're in love with it. We went back and forth on that decision
        for, I dunno, at least 6 months, but we definitely should have purchased
        one earlier. We got the "Pavilion" model, which is 12.5 by 12.5 feet, so
        it's basically the same size as our main kitchen/living area in the RV.

      <p>
        In the tent, we have a collapsible camping table from REI that I set up.
        On the table I set up my laptop on a
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3wqUOtX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          Nexstand laptop stand
        </a>
        , so the screen is higher up and I'm not hunching over to look down at
        it and wrecking my back. Then I can use my external mouse and keyboard
        like normal. I set up my collapsible chair I mentioned earlier, and
        BOOM! Outdoor office, baby! It really is a dreamy setup when it's cool
        outside, and a light breeze is blowing. Couldn't ask for a better
        office.

      <h2>The mobile office</h2>
      <p>
        And then comes the mobile office. We've all been there. Sometimes the
        internet at the campground just can't. We have a Verizon and AT&amp;T
        plan, so usually between the two of them we can work things out. But not
        always. For those times, I take basically the same setup I have in the
        outdoor tent on the road. The laptop, stand, mouse, and keyboard all fit
        in a little backpack. So usually I can just set that up at a coffee shop
        or library and be good to go. I'll always throw an extension cord in the
        backpack just in case there's not an outlet close by. And I'll usually
        throw the collapsible table in the truck just in case. It has definitely
        come in handy a time or two.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a last resort, I can set up directly in the truck itself. I have a
        headrest laptop mount that holds the laptop on the back of the driver
        headrest (although I can't actually find a link to this product on
        Amazon anymore, so it may have been discontinued). I can prop the laptop
        up there, and sit in the back seat with a
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3bW1oit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          portable laptop tray
        </a>
        to hold my mouse and keyboard. This setup is always my last resort, if
        the internet at the campground is a no go, and the weather outside is
        ghastly, and it's a global pandemic and I'm not allowed inside of any
        buildings. Things happen, ya know? But it works surprisingly well when
        there's nothing else.
